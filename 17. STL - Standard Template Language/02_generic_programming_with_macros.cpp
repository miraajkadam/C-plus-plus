Generic programming with macros
- Writing code that works with a avariety of types as arguments as lone as those argument tupes meet 
  specific syntactic and semantic requirements" - Bjarnge Stroustrup (C++ Developer)

Macros (#define)
- C++ preprocessor directives
- No type info
- Simple substitution

#define PI 3.14
#define MAX_SIZE 100
