/*

A library of powerful, reusable, adaptable, generic classes and functions
Implemented using C++ templates
Implements common data structures and algorithms

Alexander Stepanov (1994) <-- Developer

STL
- Assortment of commonly used containers
- known time and size complexity
- Reusablity
- Consistent, fast and type-safe
- Extensible 

Elements
- Containers - Collections of objects or primitive types (array, vectors, deque, stack, set, map, etc)
- Algorithm - Functions for processing sequences of elements from containers (find, max, count, accumulate, sort, etc)
- Iterators - Generate sequences of lements from containers (forward reverse, by value, by reference, constant, etc)

Types of containers
- Sequence Container (array, vector, list, forward_list, deque)
- Associtive Containers (set, multiset, map, multi map)
- Contianer adaptive (stack, queue, priority queue)

Types of Interators
- Input iterators - from the container to the program
- Output Iterators - from the program to the container
- Forward iterators - navigate one item at a time in one direction
- Bi-directional iterators - navefate one item at a time in both directions
- Random access iterators - directly access a container item

Types of Algorithms
- 60 algorithms in the STL approx
- Non-modifying
- Modifying
