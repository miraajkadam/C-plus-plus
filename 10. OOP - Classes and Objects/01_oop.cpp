Procedural programming
- Focus is on processes or actions that a progarm takes
- Programs are typically a collection of functions
- Data is declared separately
- Data is passed as arguments into functions

Object-Orientation - modelling your program in classes and objects
- allows higher level of abstraction
- used successfully in very large program
- Encapsulation
- reusability
-- easy to reuse classes in other applications
- inheritence
-- reusablity
-- polymorphic classes
- polymorshism
